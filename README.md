LifeHarbour High-Level Design:
1. User Interface (React Frontend):
Developed using React for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
Communicates with backend services through RESTful APIs.
2. API Gateway:
Acts as the entry point for external requests.
Handles authentication, authorization, and routes requests to the appropriate microservices.
Implements rate limiting, logging, and potentially caching.
3. Microservices:
a. User Service:
- Manages user authentication and authorization.
- Stores user profiles and preferences in PostgreSQL.
- Communicates with other services for user-related tasks.

b. Activity Service:
- Manages core functionality for tracking activities.
- Performs CRUD operations for activities in PostgreSQL.
- Communicates with the User Service for user information.

c. Notification Service:
- Handles notifications for upcoming activities or reminders.
- Utilizes Kafka for asynchronous communication with other services.
- Communicates with the User Service and Activity Service.

d. Calendar Service:
- Manages user calendars and schedules.
- Integrates with the Activity Service for scheduling events.
- Communicates with the Notification Service.

4. Data Storage (PostgreSQL):
PostgreSQL database for storing user profiles, activity data, and calendar information.
Ensures data consistency and integrity across microservices.
5. Message Queue (Kafka):
Facilitates asynchronous communication between microservices.
The Notification Service publishes messages about upcoming activities.
6. Security:
OAuth 2.0 for user authentication and authorization.
Encryption of sensitive data in transit and at rest.
7. Containerization (Docker):
Containerizes each microservice and the frontend application for easy deployment and scalability.
8. Orchestration (Kubernetes):
Uses Kubernetes for orchestrating and managing the deployment of microservices.
9. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
Implements CI/CD pipelines for automated building, testing, and deployment.
Utilizes Jenkins, GitLab CI, or a similar tool.
10. Testing:
Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for each microservice and the frontend.
Automated testing tools like JUnit, Jest, and Selenium.
11. Monitoring and Logging:
Implements monitoring using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
Centralized logging using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
12. Code Quality:
Utilizes code quality tools such as SonarQube to analyze and maintain code quality.
13. Artifact Repository:
Centralized repository for storing Docker images and other artifacts.
Workflow:
User interacts with the React frontend.
API Gateway handles external requests, performs authentication, and routes requests to the appropriate microservices.
Microservices communicate with each other through RESTful APIs and Kafka for asynchronous events.
Data is stored and retrieved from PostgreSQL databases.
CI/CD pipelines automate the building, testing, and deployment of microservices.
Monitoring tools provide insights into system performance.
Code quality tools ensure code integrity and identify areas for improvement.
This high-level design outlines the main components and their interactions within the LifeHarbour microservices architecture. It is important to consider scalability, fault tolerance, and security at each stage of the development and deployment process.
